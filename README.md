# Student Management System

A robust and user-friendly **Student Management System** built with Python. This project demonstrates the practical application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **JSON-based data persistence**, and **Error Handling**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Create:** Add new student records with unique Roll Numbers.
- **Read:** View a formatted list of all registered students.
- **Search:** Quickly find a student's details using their Roll Number.
- **Update:** Modify existing student names or marks.
- **Delete:** Remove student records from the database.
- **Analytics:** View class statistics including Average, Highest, and Lowest marks.
- **Data Persistence:** Automatically saves data to a `students.json` file so no data is lost when the program closes.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Encapsulates logic within the `StudentManager` class for better code organization.
- **JSON Module:** Used for reading and writing data to a local file.
- **Exception Handling:** Robust `try-except` blocks to handle invalid user inputs and file errors.
- **Match-Case Logic:** Utilizes Python's modern structural pattern matching (Python 3.10+).

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher installed on your system.
